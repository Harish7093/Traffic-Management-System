# Traffic Management System - Setup and Usage Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV 
- PyTorch
- Streamlit
- Arduino IDE (for hardware setup)
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect Arduino board to USB port
2. Upload traffic_signals.ino sketch to Arduino
3. Configure ESP32-CAM with provided firmware
4. Connect traffic light modules to specified Arduino pins

## Software Setup
1. unzip and open TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM .zip file in  vs code:
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Place trained model files in /models directory
4. Update COM port in Combined_Detection.py if needed

## Running the Application
1. Navigate to project directory
2. Launch Streamlit app:
	
   ```
	cd webapp
	streamlit run Introduction.py```
3. Access web interface at http://localhost:8501
